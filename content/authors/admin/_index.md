Hi there, I'm Patrick, a PhD student in the [AI in Multimedia - Image and Video Processing Lab](https://sites.northwestern.edu/ivpl/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), working under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Katsaggelos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aucB85kAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao). My research focuses on making machine learning models more explainable, adaptable, and robust, bridging the gap between what AI can do and how well we can understand and trust it. My passion for signal processing and explainable AI began during my master’s in data science at the [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch/en/), where I was supervised by [Prof. Dr. Schuster](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_A1-3vMAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao), founder and director of the [Interdisciplinary Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ost.ch/de/forschung-und-dienstleistungen/interdisziplinaere-themen/icai-interdisciplinary-center-for-artificial-intelligence). Backed by over 10 years of hands-on industry experience in algorithm and software development, machine learning, and project management, I am driven to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.

On a lighter note, I’m a Swiss native now calling the Chicago area my home-away-from-the-mountains for my PhD. Nothing makes me happier than gathering with friends and family—sharing stories, laughs, and those little moments that make life so great. In my free time, I’m likely lost in music, whether I’m exploring Chicago’s legendary blues scene or strumming my guitar. When I’m not geeking out on AI or enjoying live music, you’ll find me on two wheels, hitting the pavement as an avid runner, or practicing martial arts—my go-to ways for staying grounded (and letting off a bit of steam!). I’d love to connect, share ideas, and explore potential collaborations—feel free to reach out, and let’s make something exciting happen!

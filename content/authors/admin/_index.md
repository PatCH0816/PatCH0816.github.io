<!-- Patrick is currently a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Davide Scaramuzza](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/people_scaramuzza.html) at the [Robotics and Perception Group](https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/), which is part of the Department of Informatics, at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html), and the Department of Neuroinformatics, which is a joint institute of both the University of Zurich and [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). During his PhD, he worked at the [Biomimetic Robotics Lab](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/people) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu/) with [Prof. Sangbae Kim](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/SANGBAE@MIT.EDU).
Before his PhD, Patrick received his master’s degree from [TU Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp) under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Member/JanPeters).

In his research, Patrick focuses on creating new control algorithms that leverage the fundamental concepts in optimal control, reinforcement learning, and differentiable physics. 
He has developed the [Flightmare](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/flightmare) Simulator and the first reinforcement learning [policy](https://youtu.be/0d1fEvTJFtI) that pushes a super agile drone to its maximum performance in the physical world. 
<!-- Recently, he achieved one of the first demonstration of differentiable-simulation-enabled real-world legged locomotion.  -->

On a personal level, Patrick has some interesting life experiences. He was born and raised in a [small, remote village](https://github.com/yun-long/yun-long.github.io/blob/main/content/authors/admin/home.jpg) in South China, an area with very limited access to proper education due to poverty. From the age of six, Patrick was involved in farming, accumulating over a decade of experience in the field. :) He also gained experience working in several Chinese factories. He financed his Master's studies in Germany by working part-time at a software company and as a student assistant at the university. Patrick deeply understands the value of proper education. His life goal is to eliminate the educational barriers he once faced or, at least, help others get a better education.

I am a PhD student at Northwestern University supervised by [Prof. Dr. Katsaggelos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aucB85kAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) with a passion for advancing the fields of explainability, domain adaptation/generalization, and machine learning model robustness. Backed by over 10 years of hands-on industry experience in algorithm and software development, machine learning, and project management, I am driven to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications.
